# Student Randomizer

## Problem
    There is a list of student names(unsorted) in an array and another array with letters (A-Z)
    We need to shuffle the letters randomly. Then access each letters from the list
    and print the names that starts with the current letter


## Solution
    1. Generate letters array 
    2. Sort the names in ascending order
    3. Randonly shuffle the letters array
    4. Take each letters from the randonly shuffled array and print name from names in which name starts with current letter
